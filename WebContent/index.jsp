This is the first version of the application BankingWeb
We add this line in the second version
and will continue adding more exiting stuff
as we did today 
testing the rule to add a changeset automatically 
relate the revision to it
build and deploy it to the DEV environment
after generating a job with a pipeline 
and deploying the war file to the DEV environment
